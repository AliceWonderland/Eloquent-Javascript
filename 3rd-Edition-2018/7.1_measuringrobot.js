/*
Write a function compareRobots which takes two robots (and their starting memory). It should generate a hundred tasks, and let each of the robots solve each of these tasks. When done, it should output the average number of steps each robot took per task.


  For the sake of fairness, make sure that you give each task to both robots, rather than generating different tasks per robot.
